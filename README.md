# MakeStylish
A Stylish Website on Functional Programming

- A Responsive Website on Functional Programming. Over time,
  I plan to include more, and add more pages, etc.
  
- Essentially includes a brief bio about Alonzo Church, Category Theory, Lambda Calculus, as well as references.

## Things I'd like to include in the future:

- Galois Theory 
- Type Theory 
- Images in LaTeX
- Examples of Languages that are functional eg. Haskell, Idris
- Proof languages like Coq (small write-up on)
